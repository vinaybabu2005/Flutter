Flutter is Googleâ€™s open-source UI toolkit for building natively compiled apps for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Using Dart, it offers fast performance, a rich set of customizable widgets, and a reactive framework to create beautiful, responsive, and high-quality user interfaces.
